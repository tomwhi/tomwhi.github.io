Greetings, I'm Tom Whitington, a data scientist and former bioinformatician. I have over a decade of experience in answering complex and difficult-to-define questions through the application of statistics and programming with scientific rigour. By applying computational and statistical methods to large and diverse genomics datasets, I have delivered [high impact research outcomes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1280JtcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en), including two co-first author articles in the journal Nature Genetics.

From 2018, I've been working as a data scientist at Schibsted, focusing on applications of deep learning within re-commerce and news media.
