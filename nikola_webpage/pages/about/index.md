My name is Tom Whitington, I'm a data scientist and bioinformatician. I have over ten years' experience in answering complex and difficult-to-define questions through the application of statistics, programming, and the scientific method.

By applying computational and statistical methods to large and diverse genomics datasets, I have delivered [high impact research outcomes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1280JtcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en), including two co-first author articles in the journal Nature Genetics.

I am currently employed in a permanent position as a bioinformatician at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Whilst I enjoy this role, I am amazed by recent developments in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and am considering working as a data scientist in this area. I believe I have the imagination and technical background needed to deliver results with these technologies ([example](https://tomwhi.github.io/blog/posts/using-word-vectors-to-decipher-swedish-culture/)).
